# The NT API BSOD Machine
NT API BSOD Machine is a C# program to BSOD the system. This takes advantage of 2 undocumented NT API method that working together, raises a BSOD with an error code (This has been patched on ReactOS).

This does NOT require administrator permissions to BSOD the system, this function has existed since atleast Windows XP (AFAIK).

do not question what I do when bored

***

-`RtlAdjustPriviledge(int Priviledge, bool EnablePriviledge, bool IsThreadPriviledge, out bool PreviousVal)` - Changes the priviledge in the current process or thread.

-`NtRaiseHardError(uint ErrorStatus, uint NumOfParams, uint UnicodeStrParamMask, IntPtr Params, uint ValidResponseOption, out uint Response)` - Sends a HARDERROR_MSG LPC message to CSRSS.exe. Using the error status `0xC0000420` causes it to trigger a BSOD with STATUS_ASSERTION_FAILURE.
